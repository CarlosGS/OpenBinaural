The awesome ear model was designed by Jonathan March:

For this project, the STL had to be fixed with [FreeCAD](http://freecadweb.org/) and [Blender](http://www.blender.org/)  

Great inspiration was taken from [3Dio](http://3diosound.com/).
If you need professional quality & high-performance, check out their Free Space microphones!  

The potentiometer knob model is derived from John Ridley's: <https://www.youmagine.com/designs/knob-for-potentiometer-parametric>
